# This is the OpenAPI specification for your service. It is used to generate the client code.
# To generate the server code, use the Gradle task `openApiGenerate`. The 
# generated code will be placed in `build/generate-resources/main`.
#
# We will evaluate you based on how well you design your API.
# 1. How well it follows REST principles.
# 2. How easy it is to understand and use.
